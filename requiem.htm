<P><B><I>Requiem Illumina:  In Memory of the Light</B></I></P>
<P>This is to be my premiere work.  The idea for Requiem Illumina has been in development for three years.</P>
<P>  What is Requiem Illumina?  It is a book, it is a novel, it is a role-playing game, but most of all, it is a setting.</P>
<P>  Requiem Illumina takes place in the future, about 75 years from now.  For some unknown reason the sun has ceased to shine it's light upon our world.  The plants have all died, and many animals have too.  Without plants to process the air, oxygen is depleting quickly.  The vast majority of the world's population have starved to death, or were killed in the chaos of the first years in darkness.  Society has been forced back to the Dark Ages, and mankind struggles to survive in a world where food is rarer than gold.</P>
<P>  Enter the Greys.  The mysterious race that had long been thought to be of some extraterrestrial origin, has in fact turned out to be of a more terrestrial origin, but they are no less mysterious.  They have spent thousands of years, hiding in underground caves, building and advancing beyond the capabilities of humans.  They approach humanity with an offer:  they give us food and air, we become their unconditional slaves.</P>
<P>  Some refuse, prefering instead to flee to the wildlands and live by whatever means they can.  Many accept, willing to give their freedom in exchange for the security the Greys can offer.</P>
<P>  The book is divided into three parts:  part one is an autobiography of a man named Richard Stallman, one of the few survivors who still remembers what it was like to see the sun; part two is a reference work, detailing the world of Requiem Illumina through the eyes of Mr. Stallman; part three contains DarkFUDGE, our own customized version of Steffan O'Sullivan's excellent FUDGE roleplaying game, designed for use with Requiem Illumina.</P>
<P>  I also would like to publish a version contain only part one, and possibly part two.  Requiem Illumina is primarily a world, and hopefully fascinating enough to interest even non-roleplayers.</P>
<P>  What is roleplaying?  Think of it as sort of an improvisational acting or storytelling game.  One player called the gamemaster creates a story, and the rest of the players create characters to interact within the story.  The gamemaster presents the story to the players and they respond according to their character's personality and abilities.  Rules are created to allow the players and the gamemaster to determine if a character succeeds at any action where there is some doubt about whether they could succeed.</P>
<P>  For continuing information about Requiem Illumina, keep watching this site for further details.</P>
